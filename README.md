### Alternate approach for creating react applications

**Methods**

- >NPX <br>

   ```
    npx create-react-app <project_name>
   ```

What is NPX- it is an NPM package runner which gets installed when you install node and that is how we are able to run creat react app without having to install it.

- >NPM <br>

  ```
   npm install create-react-app-g
   create-react-app < project_name >
  ```


In this approach we install the creat react app package globally and use the package to generate the projects
